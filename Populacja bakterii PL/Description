This is a program that checks when the bacterial population will reach 1000000000. I wanted the Polish language version especially, because the code in this variant
contains an additional loop defining the form of the word "hour". I did this using the remainder of dividing by 10. The program will never run more than 30 loops (then
it reaches the mentioned value), but thanks to the use of loops it is universal and if it executed more loops it would still invert the word "hour" correctly.
